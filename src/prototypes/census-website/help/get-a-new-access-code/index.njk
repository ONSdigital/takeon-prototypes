    <p>To do the census online you need a 16 character unique access code which we have sent you in a letter.</p>
    <p>If you are in a <a href="/prototypes/census-website/about-the-census/the-2019-census-rehearsal">rehearsal area</a> and donâ€™t have a code you can get a new one.</p>
    <p>You will need to provide:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>your mobile number so we can send you the code by text</li>
        <li>your address so we can confirm you are in the rehearsal area</li>
    </ul>
