    <p>If you need help filling in the census, then there a few different ways to get help:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/prototypes/census-website/contact/">call our contact centre</a> using the free phone number</li>
        <li>ask someone you trust to help you</li>
        <li>in person by visiting one of the <a href="/prototypes/census-website/help/finding-support-to-complete-your-census/help-centre-venues.html">help centre venues</a> set up to provide help</li>
    </ul>
    {% from "components/panel/_macro.njk" import onsPanel %}            
    <p>Our staff will offer you help to get online and fill in the census. You can take your own mobile device, or you can use a laptop or tablet provided at the venue.</p>
    <p>You will need to bring your letter with the 16 digit unique access code. Youâ€™ll also need to have access to the information we ask for in the census. For examples, dates of birth, addresses, employer details.</p>
    <h2>Helping someone else fill in their census</h2>
    <p>If someone is happy to give you their answers then you can fill out the survey for them. If they are not able to give their own answers then you must make sure you answer with what you know to be true about them.</p>
