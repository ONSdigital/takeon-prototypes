  <h2>If you have not seen a census letter</h2>
    <p>If you are the householder and think you should have received a letter, <a href="/prototypes/census-website/contact/">contact us to get a unique access code.</a></p>
    <p>If you are not the householder check with them to see if they have the census letter with the unique access code. You can use the code to complete your individual questions.</p>
    <p>This may not be possible, or you may not want the people you live with to see your answers. You can <a href="https://sdc-prototypes.netlify.com/prototypes/rh-census/address.html">get a new code to respond separately to the household</a>. We will send it to you by text.</p>
