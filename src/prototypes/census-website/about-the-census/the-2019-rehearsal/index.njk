    <p>In preparation for Census 2021, we at the Office for National Statistics (ONS) will be holding a census rehearsal in October 2019.<br></p><h2><strong>Why we need a rehearsal</strong></h2><p>The census aims to count everyone in England and Wales, which makes it a pretty big task. No other survey gives as much information about us and our society. Having a rehearsal will help make sure our processes, systems and services are running smoothly. The rehearsal will take place in October 2019. It’s a practice run so we get things right for the real thing.</p><h2><strong>Where the rehearsal is taking place</strong></h2><p>We’ve chosen four areas to rehearse the census as together they represent a good cross section of our society. The areas are:</p><ul><li>Carlisle</li><li>Ceredigion</li><li>Hackney</li><li>Tower Hamlets</li></ul><h2><strong>What you’ll need to do</strong></h2><p>If you live in one of the rehearsal areas, we’ll send you a letter if we need you to take part.</p><p>It’s important you get involved in the rehearsal. The more people that respond, the better we can make the census in 2021.</p>
