        <p>We really want to inspire a new generation to take part in the census.</p>
        <p>We’ve developed an exciting free education programme to help teach children in primary schools about the census. Let’s Count! includes census-inspired lesson plans to support learning across the main areas of the English and Welsh Curriculum.</p>
        <p>The programme is currently available to all primary schools in the four census rehearsal areas: Carlisle, Ceredigion, Hackney and Tower Hamlets.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Schools in these areas will also be encouraged to host a Let’s Count! day in October and enter a competition.</p>
        <p>Children will be challenged to count all the different things they find on a short walk around the school and share what they find in exciting ways. Prizes will be awarded for the best entries.</p>
        <p>The Let’s Count! website has plenty of resources available for teachers and parents to use. These include leaflets, presentations and posters. For more information,
